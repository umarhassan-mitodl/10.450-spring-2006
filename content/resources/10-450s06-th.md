  caption: A large tank must be filled with liquid from a supply line. One operator
    stands at ground level to operate the feed valve. Another stands on the tank,
    gauging its level with a dipstick. When the tank is near full, the stick operator
    will instruct the other to start closing the valve. Overfilling can cause spills,
    but underfilling will cause later process problems. See Lesson 1 to find a better
    way! (Lesson 1 image by Dr. Barry Johnston.)
