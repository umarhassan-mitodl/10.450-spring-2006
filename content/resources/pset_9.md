description: This problem set reviews the old procedure of estimating closed-loop
  stability by the Bode method, as well as tuning by gain and phase margins. The pretext
  is a change of controlled variable for the stirred reactor of Lesson 6; you will
  use the linearized model of Lesson 6 to do the engineering for this change. It should
  provide a striking illustration of the effect of nonlinearity on our linear models.
  Again, use the spreadsheet "exothermic reactor for pset8.xls" to calculate steady-state
  conditions.
